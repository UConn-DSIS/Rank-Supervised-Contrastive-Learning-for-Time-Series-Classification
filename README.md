# RankSCL
This is the official repository of Rank Supervised Contrastive Learning for Time Series Classification, which was published in ICDM 2024 [https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18057](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18057). We will keep maintaining this repository to faciliate the development of continual graph learning, and we appreciate any comment on improving our RankSCL! 

## Prerequisites
```pyhton
conda create -n "envname" python=3.7.0
conda activate envname
```

## Prepare Datasets
We use 128 UCR datasets and 30 UEA datasets to do the classification task, you can download all of the data on these two websites:
